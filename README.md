# SheetMidiRetrieval

This repository contains the code for our ISMIR 2019 paper "MIDI Passage Retrieval Using Cell Phone Pictures of 
Sheet Music" and TMM journal article "Using Cell Phone Pictures of Sheet Music To Retrieve MIDI Passages."

The goal of this system is to retrieve a specific passage of music from a MIDI file by taking a cell phone picture of a 
physical page of the sheet music.

You can find the papers and datasets [here](http://pages.hmc.edu/ttsai).

## Installation

After cloning this repository, you will also need to download and unzip the dataset into the project directory.
After that, you can simply run the jupyter notebooks in order.
